dropincc.java Quick Start.
=============

### What is dropincc.java?
* A small, and easy to use parser generator.
* It is designed to ease your DSL building process in java.
* No new grammar need to learn, no additional command line tool need to use. All you need to do is define your DSL grammar in your favorite editor using pure java.
* It has very nice BNF-alike fluent interface API to define grammar rules.
* Recognizes LL(*) grammar, and supports powerful semantic predicates that could even handle context-sensitive parsing.
* No other dependencies except for the built-in java library, requires JDK 1.6 or above.

### Hello World.
As to parser generators, a full-featured calculator is more or less like a _Hello World_ example.  
Here is this resulting _Hello World_ example in dropincc.java:  

    /**
     * EBNF of Calculator:
     * 
     * <pre>
     * calc ::= expr $
     * expr ::= addend (('+'|'-') addend)*
     * addend ::= factor (('*'|'/') factor)*
     * factor ::= '(' expr ')'
     *          | '\\d+(\\.\\d+)?'
     * </pre>
     */
    public static void main(String... args) throws Throwable {
        Lang c = new Lang("Calculator");
        Grule expr = c.newGrule();
        c.defineGrule(expr, CC.EOF).action(new Action<Object>() {
            public Double act(Object matched) {
                return (Double) ((Object[]) matched)[0];
            }
        });
        TokenDef a = c.newToken("\\+");
        Grule addend = c.newGrule();
        expr.define(addend, CC.ks(a.or("\\-"), addend)).action(new Action<Object>() {
            public Double act(Object matched) {
                Object[] ms = (Object[]) matched;
                Double a0 = (Double) ms[0];
                Object[] aPairs = (Object[]) ms[1];
                for (Object p : aPairs) {
                    String op = (String) ((Object[]) p)[0];
                    Double a = (Double) ((Object[]) p)[1];
                    if ("+".equals(op)) {
                        a0 += a;
                    } else {
                        a0 -= a;
                    }
                }

        TokenDef m = c.newToken("\\*");
        Grule factor = c.newGrule();
        addend.define(factor, CC.ks(m.or("/"), factor)).action(new Action<Object>() {
            public Double act(Object matched) {
                Object[] ms = (Object[]) matched;
                Double f0 = (Double) ms[0];
                Object[] fPairs = (Object[]) ms[1];
                for (Object p : fPairs) {
                    String op = (String) ((Object[]) p)[0];
                    Double f = (Double) ((Object[]) p)[1];
                    if ("*".equals(op)) {
                        f0 *= f;
                    } else {
                        f0 /= f;
                    }
                }
                return f0;
            }
        });
        factor.define("\\(", expr, "\\)").action(new Action<Object>() {
            public Double act(Object matched) {
                return (Double) ((Object[]) matched)[1];
            }
        }).alt("\\d+(\\.\\d+)?").action(new Action<Object>() {
            public Double act(Object matched) {
                return Double.parseDouble((String) matched);
            }
        });
        Exe exe = c.compile();
        System.out.println(exe.<Double>eval("1 +2+3+(4 +5*6*7*(64/8/2/(2/1 )/1)*8  +9  )+   10"));
    }

As you can see, these dozens of lines of pure java code defined a non-trivial calculator which supports parentheses operation.  
You can run the code above to get the output: `3389.0`. You can check this answer in any calculator app shipped along with your operating system.  

### How to build such a Calculator? Step by step:
First, write down the grammar rules as [EBNF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form):   

	calc ::= expr $
    expr ::= addend (('+'|'-') addend)*
    addend ::= factor (('*'|'/') factor)*
    factor ::= '(' expr ')'
             | '\\d+(\\.\\d+)?'
             
Terminals are in single quotes and non-terminals are those meaningful words. '$' as the EOF terminal.  
Then, translate the EBNF **line-by-line** using dropincc.java API:

	Lang c = new Lang("Calculator");
    Grule expr = c.newGrule();
    // calc ::= expr $
    c.defineGrule(expr, CC.EOF);
    
    TokenDef a = c.newToken("\\+");
    Grule addend = c.newGrule();
    // expr ::= addend (('+'|'-') addend)*
    expr.define(addend, CC.ks(a.or("\\-"), addend));
    
    TokenDef m = c.newToken("\\*");
    Grule factor = c.newGrule();
    // addend ::= factor (('*'|'/') factor)*
    addend.define(factor, CC.ks(m.or("/"), factor));
    
    /*
     * factor ::= '(' expr ')'
     *          | '\\d+(\\.\\d+)?'
     */
    factor.define("\\(", expr, "\\)")
    .alt("\\d+(\\.\\d+)?");
    
It's a very straightforward step. Just need a little explaination:  

* Basic grammar elements are 'TokenDef'(terminal) and 'Grule'(non-terminal), and you are not restricted to define TokenDefs in prior to all other elements, you can just define TokenDefs instantly, as regular expressions, while you defining the structure of your grammar. Like `expr.define(addend, CC.ks(a.or("\\-"), addend));`, the `"\\-"` is a regex, it defines a TokenDef on-the-fly.
* Currently use built-in java regular expression to define token schemes, beware of java regExp special characters: `<([{\^-=$!|]})?*+.>`, they should be escaped when you need the character itself.
* Elements concatenations are expressed in comma separated sequences, `expr, CC.EOF` means `expr $` for example.
* Alternative productions are expressed as a `alt` method call, for example, the `factor` rule has two alternative productions, the second one is defined as `.alt("\\d+(\\.\\d+)?");`.
* Inline alternatives are expressed as a `or` method call on elements. See `a.or("\\-")` or `m.or("/")` in above definitions.  
* Kleene star/cross notations is expressed as `CC.ks` and `CC.kc` function call, and `CC.op` for optional grammar element.

Ok, as you have successfully translated EBNF to the form of dropincc.java required, it's time to add **actions** to your grammar rules.  

Well, those actions are in fact 'closures', it can catch-up any variables in your current context. In java, this is done by defining an anonymous inner class.  
For example, I first added two actions for the two alternative productions of `factor` rule: 

	factor.define("\\(", expr, "\\)").action(new Action() {
        public Double act(Object matched) {
            return (Double) ((Object[]) matched)[1];
        }
    }).alt("\\d+(\\.\\d+)?").action(new Action() {
        public Double act(Object matched) {
            return Double.parseDouble((String) matched);
        }
    });
    
`Action` is the interface to define such a closure. The `matched` param of the only method `act` in `Action` are an array of matched tokens or a single matched token.  
Whether it is array or single token is up to the number of elements in the corresponding alternative production:  

* The `matched` parameter in the action of the first alternative production is a three tokens array: \["(", returnedValueOfEnclosingExprRule, ")"\]
* The second alt's `matched` parameter is a single string object represents the matched digit.
* The return value of actions are treated as the returned value of the whole rule when parsing. It could be used for further processing by the invoking rule, for example, the second element of the first `matched` array is a returned value from the enclosing `expr` rule.  

When you have done adding all proper actions to all grammar rule's productions, you are almost winning. The last step is to compile your new created language:  

	Exe exe = c.compile();
	
Then, enjoy it:  

	System.out.println(exe.eval("1 +2+3+(4 +5*6*7*(64/8/2/(2/1 )/1)*8  +9  )+   10"));
	
The resulting `exe` object is thread-safe and is suggested to be cached for future use.  

There lies many stuff of complexity in the implementation of dropincc.java, but to the end user, I believe it could turns out to be a form of simplicity.

That's it, dropincc.java, a new parser generator which you have never seen. It is not just 'yet another compiler compiler', because there is already a whole bunch of tools to do such kind of general purposed parser generation. It is aimed to help you create DSLs in java. Which is a neglected topic in java community. 

In order to make the example code above run, make sure that you are using jdk 1.6 or above and all you need to do is put the dropincc.java's compiled [jar file](https://github.com/pfmiles/dropincc.java/releases) in your classpath, no other dependencies. 

More examples and documentation coming soon... You could explore the [wiki page](https://github.com/pfmiles/dropincc.java/wiki) or my [blog](http://pfmiles.github.com/blog/category/dropincc/) to find more information.

### NOTES

* The current stable release is v0.2.1.
* The developing v0.3.0 and master branch may not be compatible with v0.2.x, but v0.2.x would be continuously maintained at branch `0.2.x`.
* v0.3.0 will be a BIG release, and it surely will provide you a new powerful DSL tool. But... currently, we could just hold on v0.2.x because it's released and runs dozens of millions of times every day in more than one important production systems. The correctness is proven.
